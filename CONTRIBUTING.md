##  Code of Conduct 📜

Before contributing, please familiarize yourself with our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/json-schema-org/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).


##  How to Contribute 🚀

There are several ways you can contribute to the JSON Schema website:

* [**Reporting Bugs** 🐞](#reporting-bugs-)
* [**Suggesting Features** 💡](#suggesting-features-)
* [**Improving the Landscape** 🌐](#improving-the-landscape-)

### Reporting Bugs 🐞

Encountered a bug on the website? Please use the issue templates to report it. The templates provide guidance on the information needed to help us resolve the issue.

### Suggesting Features 💡 

Do you have an idea for a new feature that could improve the website? Open an issue to share your suggestion.  Refer to the "Improving the Landscape" section for details on creating issues.

### Improving the Docs 🚧

We welcome your help in making the JSON Schema Landscape documentation even better! Here's how you can contribute:

* **Spot a mistake? Have a suggestion for clarity?** You can directly edit the Markdown files used for the documentation in a pull request.


* **Limited content type changes:** If you have ideas for improvements that don't involve code changes (like typos, grammar, or better explanations), you can follow these steps:

    1. **Identify your contribution:** Is it a documentation fix, improved clarity, or a suggestion for better phrasing? 
    1. **Make your changes:** Edit the relevant Markdown file.
    1. **Create a pull request:** Submit a pull request with your changes and a clear description of the improvements.

## Improving the Landscape 🌐

We welcome your help in making the JSON Schema Landscape website even better! Here's how you can contribute:

The website is built with a tool called CNCF Landscape, designed for managing this type of information. While large code edits aren't possible, some customization is achievable through configuration and themes.

* Have an idea for a new feature that works within CNCF Landscape's limitations? Open an issue to discuss your proposal. We use a project board to track website contribution tasks: [link to project board](https://github.com/orgs/json-schema-org/projects/19).




## Pull Requests 📬

We welcome pull requests for bug fixes, new features, and content improvements. 

* If your pull request addresses a specific issue, please reference the issue number in your pull request description. This helps us link and close the issue when the pull request is merged.
* Generally, pull requests should be submitted to the `main` branch.
* Most pull requests will be open for review for at least 14 days. Minor fixes may be merged more quickly once approved by a project member.

For more details on creating pull requests, refer to GitHub's documentation: [https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests)
