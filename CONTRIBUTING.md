## Improving the Website 🌐

We welcome your help in making the JSON Schema Landscape website even better! Here's how you can contribute:

#### **Improve the Content:**

* See a mistake in the documentation? Have a suggestion to make it clearer? You can directly edit the Markdown files (used for the readme and contributing guide) in a pull request.
* **Note:** Most website content uses YAML files, a data format, instead of Markdown (used for writing).

**Limited Website Functionality Changes:**

The website is built with a tool called CNCF Landscape, designed for managing this type of information. While large code edits aren't possible, some customization is achievable through configuration and themes.

* Have an idea for a new feature that works within CNCF Landscape's limitations? Open an issue to discuss your proposal. We use a project board to track website contribution tasks: link to project board: [https://github.com/orgs/json-schema-org/projects/19](https://github.com/orgs/json-schema-org/projects/19).

**Getting Started with Content or Design:**

These steps are for improvements that don't involve code changes:

1. **Identify your contribution:**
    * Is it a documentation fix?
    * Do you have a design suggestion?
1. **Make your changes:**
    * Content: Edit the relevant Markdown or YAML file [(refer to the note above)](#improve-the-content).

1. **Create a pull request:** Submit a pull request with your changes and a clear description of the improvements.

## Pull Requests 📬

We welcome pull requests for bug fixes, new features, and content improvements. 

* If your pull request addresses a specific issue, please reference the issue number in your pull request description. This helps us link and close the issue when the pull request is merged.
* Generally, pull requests should be submitted to the `main` branch.
* Most pull requests will be open for review for at least 14 days. Minor fixes may be merged more quickly once approved by a project member.

For more details on creating pull requests, refer to GitHub's documentation: [https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests)
