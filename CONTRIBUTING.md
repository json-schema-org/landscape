##  Code of Conduct 📜

Before contributing, please familiarize yourself with our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/json-schema-org/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).


##  How to Contribute 🚀

There are several ways you can contribute to the JSON Schema website:

* [**Adding a new Organization** 🐞](#adding-a-new-organization-)
* [**Reporting Bugs** 🐞](#reporting-bugs-)
* [**Suggesting Features** 💡](#suggesting-features-)
* [**Improving the Landscape** 🌐](#improving-the-landscape-)

## Adding a new Organization 🌐

Do you know about an Organization using JSON Schema? Add it!!

You can add a new Organization by using the [Adopters form](https://forms.gle/HNZs4vt49GWPPGQq5), [creating an issue](https://github.com/json-schema-org/landscape/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Status%3A+triage&projects=&template=add_org.yml&title=%F0%9F%8C%90+Add+new+organisation) or by submitting a PR to edit landscape.yml file. If your Organization is listed but you like it to be removed, please submit a PR removing it.

Guidelines: Please follow [the CNCF Landscape guidelines](https://github.com/cncf/landscapeapp?tab=readme-ov-file#adding-and-managing-landscape-entries) to provide the right information. 

Looking for extra credit? We also do [case studies](https://github.com/orgs/json-schema-org/projects/8/views/2) and accept sponsorship via [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/json-schema).

<summary>Find out more about case studies</summary>
If your Organization would like to share more about what you're doing in public, there's a good chance we'd love to collaborate on a case study.

Please reach out to us via [our Slack](https://json-schema.org/slack) or creating a new Issue in this repo.

From experience, these case studies can take some time to develop, write, get approved, and published. It's best if you can find out for sure if you can publish a case study with us as early as possible. If you're at a big organization, you'll likely have to get approval from people who have no idea what you're talking about. Here's some context you can share with them.

By supporting JSON Schema with a case study, you are documenting its success and your smarts in picking it as a solution. JSON Schema case studies help justify the ongoing financial support required to mature, develop, and support the JSON Schema ecosystem. Case studies also demonstrate the strength of the JSON Schema ecosystem in production today. The next case study could be you.

### Reporting Bugs 🐞

Encountered a bug on the website? Please use the issue templates to report it. The templates provide guidance on the information needed to help us resolve the issue.

### Suggesting Features 💡 

The website is built with a tool called CNCF Landscape, designed for managing this type of information. While large code edits aren't possible, some customization is achievable through configuration and themes.

Have an idea for a new feature that works within CNCF Landscape's limitations? Open an issue to discuss your proposal. We use a project board to track website contribution tasks: [link to project board](https://github.com/orgs/json-schema-org/projects/19).

### Improving the Docs 🚧

We welcome your help in making the JSON Schema Landscape documentation even better! Here's how you can contribute:

* **Spot a mistake? Have a suggestion for clarity?** You can directly edit the Markdown files used for the documentation in a pull request.


* **Limited content type changes:** If you have ideas for improvements that don't involve code changes (like typos, grammar, or better explanations), you can follow these steps:

    1. **Identify your contribution:** Is it a documentation fix, improved clarity, or a suggestion for better phrasing? 
    1. **Make your changes:** Edit the relevant Markdown file.
    1. **Create a pull request:** Submit a pull request with your changes and a clear description of the improvements.

## Pull Requests 📬

We welcome pull requests for bug fixes, new features, and content improvements. 

* If your pull request addresses a specific issue, please reference the issue number in your pull request description. This helps us link and close the issue when the pull request is merged.
* Generally, pull requests should be submitted to the `main` branch.
* Most pull requests will be open for review for at least 14 days. Minor fixes may be merged more quickly once approved by a project member.

For more details on creating pull requests, refer to GitHub's documentation: [https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests)
