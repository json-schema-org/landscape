        This is a living segmentation of the evolving JSON Schema Ecosystem. Its creation was inspired by by the amazing work done with different CNCF landscapes and the [Landscape2 project](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2).

        This first iteration of the landscape focus on JSON Schema Adopters and Sponsors, however the JSON Schema is huge and we are just getting started to map Organizations. 

        If you have doubts, have a proposal to improve the JSON Schema Landscape or like to add or remove your Organization please check the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/json-schema-org/landscape/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
